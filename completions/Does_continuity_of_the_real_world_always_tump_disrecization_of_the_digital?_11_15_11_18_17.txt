PROMPT: Does continuity of the real world always tump disrecization of the digital?

---

 The digital's recursive and immaterial qualities benefit from the discretizing functions of the real world.

 (Stiegler and Sprey, “Penser avec Deleuze/Thinking with Deleuze/Dazeluzian Thought” 123).

---

 Is it always possible to rely on a foundational, theory-neutral information ecology, and does this all-consuming ecological rush in fact cover up, rather than enabling, actual dislocatory agency? These, then, are some of the concerns that inform my ongoing engagement with a politics of resistance to or beyond the cultural industries.

---

 Wouldn’t the reverse also be possible? And, in turn, wouldn’t that blur the boundary between the two? In my view, this is exactly what is happening as regards new modes of governmentality of the impending post-anthropocene world.

---

 Does the tines and dyes of continuity imply the commonalty of digital and analog, whereas the systemity of differentiation implies an extrinsically additive, internalized digitality? All shaders operate with digital memory.

---

 Suppose that computational power becomes immense enough to manage the complexity of the real.
