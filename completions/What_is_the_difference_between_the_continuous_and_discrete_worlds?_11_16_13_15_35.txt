PROMPT: What is the difference between the continuous and discrete worlds?

---

 While philosophers have written complex treatises on the topic, sometimes the answer is unclear even to professional mathematicians.

---

 Time is continuous in the world that we experience, but discrete in a digital computer.

---

 Consider the definition of the cardinality of a set: the cardinality of a set A is the number n such that there are exactly n elements of A.

---

 In this case, I simply do not know.

---

If the world consists of discrete elements and discrete processes, then, firstly, there are no spatial and temporal continuities, secondly, there are no laws, and thirdly, there are no substances.

---



The discrete is built from parts and the continuous from wholes.
