PROMPT: What does heartbreak feel like?

---

 How do we as a mass of international consumers coincide temporally with our own loss of agency and labour? As we increasingly consume images to alleviate precarity we might be aware of the condition of precarity; the labour, precariousness, inequity, poverty and horror perpetrated in order to render the images we consume, but it will occur not as a direct recognition or confrontation of the real, but the reduction of images to solipsistic desire.

 Like a marathon runner knowing he hasn’t really run … Deleuze and Guattari will not succumb to the supposed melancholia of Kafka, with its greater appreciation of reality.

Franz Kafka, The Trial:

 Is it a crisis of meaning, or trauma, or destruction (Rifkin 1996: 290)? How about feeling excluded from the human species, which is the source of trauma for Keisha-Michelle Tyree (2012), an author and teacher from Northern Ireland, or feeling the horror of immanence in the face of extinction for the American writer Silvia Moreno-Garcia (2010)? The verbal politics of trauma, affect, color and gender stand in relation to literary temporality, such that the literary genre of theory is undermined by the double movement: one of a structural shift, beyond the sustaining syntheses of the contraband imagination; and, two, a more intensive inaugural synthesis as shock or affect.
