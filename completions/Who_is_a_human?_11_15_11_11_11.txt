PROMPT: Who is a human?

 Universal historical human? Singular universal self? Bourgeois citizen? Post-human? From where does this abstraction of the human come?

The organic body has been replaced by the machine (without soul or spirit), and then further reductions of man into brain, neuron, synapse, information enabled a second attempt at organicism through biologism.
