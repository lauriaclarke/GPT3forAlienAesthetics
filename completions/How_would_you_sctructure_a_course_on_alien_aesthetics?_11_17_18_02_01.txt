PROMPT: How would you sctructure a course on alien aesthetics?

---

 I am fond of this quote from Marie Vae Meyer: “There are no styles; there are only artists.

I conducted this little experiment in the course S478: Advanced Materialism last fall (request more info here) and it seems to be successful, so I'd like to talk about it here, in Mute, because I'm hoping to spark other thoughts about the matter.

 What texts would you define as "alien" and what genres of thought would you bring in as supporting study?

How do you connect that and link that to the current idea that aesthetic thought is becoming an obviously contested thing, with AI and technology thinking faster and faster and more logically and more systemically and more promiscuously across more areas, commerce, governance, art, culture, sciences, etc.

 The earliest thing I teach is second-order cybernetics or first-order cybernetics if you’re from Japan.

 What readings would you include? Cases studies?

What kind of writing would emerge? Pindaric odes? Colors of the wind?

Kelly Rossiter, a student in my teaching studio section on "Reading Practices," will present her book, In a True Light: Black Photographic Lensarchy and Visual Literacy, at the Association of Writing Programs conference.

 What objects, words, or images might you include and how?

What do you think of this course description? If a course gets offered using this description, would you enroll? Before you say no, remember that one of your professors likened critical theory to carpentry.
