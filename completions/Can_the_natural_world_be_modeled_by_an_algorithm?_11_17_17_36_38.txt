PROMPT: Can the natural world be modeled by an algorithm?

---

 The recently popular field of quantum computing promises to answer this question in the affirmative, through the magical ability of quantum computers to solve certain problems much faster than classical computers, because they exploit the fact that they manage information in the form of quantum bits (or qubits).

 Can algorithms replace the model of the natural world of Aristotle or Fontanelle or even Stengers? Python, the programming language and software system, was the first name in computer programming many years ago but has now given way to more famous languages.

 On the ideology of Big Data in computational science.

Nature knows no purposiveness, no goal orientation.

 Is there a way to express biological phenomena as a set of computational rules such as “IF x = y THEN z = x+1;” that can act on information and make choices?

In a recent series of papers, some of which have already been covered here on Singularity Hub, computer scientist Diego Perez-Coatls and a team from France and Chile have proposed a very interesting approach to tackling the above question that comes from another, very different type of system.

 Can nature be seen as a system of choice-embedded sequential repetitions?

Has nature already been modeled in terms of algorithms? Is the mathematical universe theory merely a reflection of scientific aspirations and beliefs? One could think here of the Platonic and Pythagorean idea that the eidē ('forms'), the pure and static essences of all things, could be captured via the fixed points in the continuum of numbers.
