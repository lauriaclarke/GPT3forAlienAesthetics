PROMPT: Is an algorithm conscious in the same way a human is?

---

 What is it that consciousness amounts to?

See also: If a tree falls in the forest and nobody is there to hear it, does it make a sound? If you program a computer to make sounds, does it matter if those sounds mean anything to anybody? My piece “The LIDA dream machine“, which weaves together cybernetics, narrative, and music, addresses some of these questions.

 At the same time, which ways of being conscious and of forming thoughts are not preserved in code? And, is the point of departure for all these questions a realist ontological assumption about what constitutes and what ought to be called thought, experience, and consciousness?

As Richter expresses it, algorithms are alien thought and alien thinking; their autonomy diverges from, or abstracts and reformulates, our own supposed autonomous reasoning, and they reveal a way of structuring and articulating information that cannot simply be considered a model or a representation of our own intelligence.

 Does consciousness possess certain properties independent of its (human) embodiments and their specific qualities? These questions can be stated in more technical terms.

 – The question is itself a marker of the Enlightenment origins of the problem.

” I also asked how we, as humans, perceive the behavior of autonomous, artificial intelligence (shall I call them “reactive agents”?) from the computational side of interest, and noted the potential for us to be biased in our assessments – against or in favor of attributing consciousness to those algorithms.

 What are the similarities and differences between algorithmic and human cognition? Do we need to include algorithmic processes in philosophical and psychological theories about the mind? To tackle these and similar issues we may adopt the terms introduced by cognitive science to describe the operations of human brains: computation and representation.
