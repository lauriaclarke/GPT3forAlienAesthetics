PROMPT: How would you teach a course on algorithmic aesthetics?

---



I essayed teaching a course on Algorithmic Aesthetics at Parsons in semester one 2011.

---



I believe that rethinking our aesthetic theories is a potential starting point for these conversations to happen.

---

 An ongoing series in which academics and others who teach introduce their course and some initial ideas.

---

 Obviously, the material that students are supposed to objectify as algorithmic is highly speculative and subject to strong influence by AI's seemingly overestimated hopes and dreams (robots, spaceships, immortality).

---

 Let me guess: You make a confusing (for some, plainly wrong) claim that algorithmic systems are somehow non-representational and donâ€™t necessitate interpretation, and then the students complain.

---

 How do you craft a writing course that lets students conduct an experiment with code?

I would love to experiment with a course that would follow-up on these questions, but I haven't had a chance yet.
