PROMPT: How would you teach a course on alien aesthetics?

---

 Lets take the idea of goo, which began as a derogatory term for human waste and is now the term for self-replicating nano/gigolo-machines as popularized in Olaf Stapledons novel Star Maker, in which ‘the tribes of the homeless worlds, possessing no fixed bodies themselves, were less hampered by the need to create worlds in which they could pursue their own private purposes.

---



There are no real grounds for the question "What is an aesthetic of other worlds and extraterrestrial life?" outside of various reconstructions of aesthetics in relation to the alien.

---



We must recognize the undeniable and fundamental importance of humanity’s techno-ontological link to the outside, manifested as techno-environment or techno-nature.

---

 This question came to me after watching Darren Aronofsky’s film, mother!.

---





I like this question because it pivots from aesthetic practice to aesthetic experience.

---

 What texts would you choose? How would you approach the topic differently from other areas of literature or the arts?


KEY POINTS

When we think about how things look, how they move and how they behave, we tend to think about human experience.
