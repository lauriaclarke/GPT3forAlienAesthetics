# GPT-3 for Alien Aesthetics

This repository contains a dataset generation script and completion tool for use in fine-tuning GPT-3. 

The example completions here have been fine-tuned on a large body of critical theory on the role of artificial intelligence in philosophy, aesthetics, media theory, art, and beyond. The collected material used in the dataset is based on the syllabus for [Alien Aesthetics](https://courses.newschool.edu/courses/NMDS5342/14395/) taught by Joshua Scannell in the fall semester of 2022 in the Media Studies department at The New School. Complete bibliography and datasets can be provided upon request. 

All instructions included here are highlevel and are not meant to be a comprehensive step by step guide to reproduce this work. 

### Contents

This repo contains the following:
- scripts/
  - pdftotext.py: a data preparation script written in python to take pdf and convert them to a .json dataset
  - completiongenerator.py: a python script for creating a file of completions generated by the model
- datasets/
  - example data sets (removed for )
- completions/
  - sample completions generated by the model (prompt and date are in filename)

**HOT TIP** when reading files in the completions' directory click the little button that says **raw** in the upper left corner to have text wrapping **HOT TIP** 


### Setup

To recreate this work on your own you will need the following\*:
- and openai account and API key linked to a paid account using [these instructions](https://beta.openai.com/docs/guides/fine-tuning)
- pdftotext, or equivalent command line tool
  - to install in Linux: ``sudo apt install poppler-utils``
- Python 3

\* this was completed on a machine running Ubuntu 22.04 and Python 3.10.6, no guarantees for other compatibility

### Steps
1. run the pdf to text script on you pdf library
2. prepare your data set using the data preparation cli tool [see here](https://beta.openai.com/docs/guides/fine-tuning)
3. submit the dataset to be used for fine-tuning the model of your choice
4. use the completion generation script with your model and api key to generate completion files
